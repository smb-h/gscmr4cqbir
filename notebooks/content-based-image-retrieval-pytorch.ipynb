Although there are number of techniques in that area as well, we'll focus on Hashing and Auto-Encoder techniques:\n","    \n","    - ***Latent Feature Extraction***: In this technique we can find feature vectors for every image by creating hooks on a pre-trained network and extracting the vector from previous layers. Other technique devises the use of **AutoEncoders** where the Latent features can be extracted from Encoder itself. For the sake of this data we'll proceed with AutoEncoders. For the retrieval part we'll look into Euclidean based Search (O(NlogN)) and Hashing Based Approaches (O(logN)).\n","    <br>\n","    - ***Image Hashing Search***: This can be done by:\n","        - Uniquely quantify the contents of an image using only a single integer.\n","        - Find duplicate or near-duplicate images in a dataset of images based on their computed hashes.<br>\n","        <br>\n","      This can be accomplished by a specialized data structure called a **VP-Tree**. Using a VP-Tree we can reduce our search complexity from O(nlogn) to O(log n), enabling us to obtain our sub-linear
